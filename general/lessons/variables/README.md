##Variables
A **variable** is a name that refers to a certain value.
In the example below you can see that when you enter `x = 5`, that value (`5`) is stored in the variable x.
When you input the command `print x`, it will print the value of `x`, which is `5`.


    >>> x = 5
    >>> print x
    5

You can change the value of a variable after you create it:

```
>>> x = 5
>>> x = 6
>>> print x
6
```

The value `5` will be stored in variable `x` until `x = 6` _overwrites_ the first value making `x` equal to `6`.

Variables can refer to different kinds of values:

```
>>> name = "Kyle"
>>> print name
Kyle
>>> pi = 3.14159
>>> print pi
3.14159
```
You can even assign a variable to be equal to the result of an arithmetic expression!

```
>>> my_num = 5 * (3 + 2)
>>> print my_num
25
```
...Or use them in arithmetic expressions:

```
>>> n = 5
>>> print 5 * n
25
```

###Making Your Programs Interactive

So far, your programs have not been able to take any input from the user. However, getting parameters from the user and operating on them is a key part of programming.

####Getting Input from the User

To get text input from the user, use the `raw_input()` function.
The example below takes the input and stores it in the variable name:

`name = raw_input()`

You can also put some text between the parentheses of the function for a prompt to ask the user:
`name = raw_input(“What is your name?”)`

**Example:**

    >>> name = raw_input()

The program will pause here to allow you to type in a value.

    Kyle

(This is something that the user types in)

    >>> print name
    Kyle
    >>> x = raw_input(“Enter a number:”)
    Enter a number: 5

Be careful — x will be a string! This problem has to do with value types, which is what the [next lesson]({{ "/general/lessons/types" | absolute_url }}) is about.

    >>> print x * 3
    555
    >>> print int(x) * 3
    15

That's it! You just learned the fundamentals of **variables**. You are now a REAL programmer.
